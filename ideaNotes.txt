---Data---

- I have the idea that we should serialize and then deserialize them in order
  of how they are opened up. So as an example: 
	- User is the first thing that is opened in the program so it is the 
	  first item that is deserialized.
	- Alongside the User, their Albums should be deserialized
	- Upon opening an Album, all Photos in the Album should be deserialized.
	  Additionally, all Tag objects associated to each Photo should be 
	  deserialized.
